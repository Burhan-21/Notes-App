# Notes-App
Java 17+ console-based Notes App for creating, viewing, listing, and deleting notes with multi-line bodies. Data persists in a text file using modern Java features like records, enhanced switch, and try-with-resources. Includes input validation, exception handling, and easy-to-use menu-driven interaction. Great for learning Java file I/O!
